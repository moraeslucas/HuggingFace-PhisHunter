# PhishHunter 

PhishHunter is an open-source NLP-based email classification tool that detects phishing attempts and explains why an email might be suspicious.

Part of the "Natural Language Processing & Language Models" project at [Porto Business School](https://www.pbs.up.pt/en/) in which we explored different library versions/requirements, etc.
